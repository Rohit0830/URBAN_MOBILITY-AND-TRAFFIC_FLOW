# Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks intended as a **self-learning** playground for basic data analysis and EDA. Keep notebooks short, explanatory, and output-stripped (use `nbstripout` or pre-commit hooks). Prefer `dataset/sampled_probe.csv` for quick experiments; add small, well-documented example notebooks rather than large, heavy computations.

## Example notebooks
- `01-data-merging-example.ipynb` — demonstrates recommended environment creation/registration, memory-safe data loads, hourly aggregation of `dataset/sampled_probe.csv`, and a merge with `dataset/synthetic_traffic_counts.csv`. Output-stripped and intended for reproducible examples.
