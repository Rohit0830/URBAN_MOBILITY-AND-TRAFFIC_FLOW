# Urban Mobility & Traffic Flow  
## End-to-End Data Analysis Project

---

## 1. Project Overview

Urbanization has led to increasing challenges in traffic congestion, travel delays, road safety, and inefficient transportation systems. This project focuses on analyzing **urban mobility and traffic flow data** to understand movement patterns within a city and to identify factors that impact congestion, efficiency, and safety.

The project follows a **complete end-to-end data analytics lifecycle**, transforming raw traffic data into meaningful insights using **Python, Excel, and Power BI** to support data-driven transportation planning and traffic management.

---

## 2. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Identify traffic congestion patterns across time and locations  
- Analyze traffic flow efficiency during peak and off-peak hours  
- Detect high-risk and accident-prone areas  
- Understand the impact of time, location, and conditions on traffic behavior  
- Provide actionable insights to improve urban mobility and road safety  

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Urban transportation systems commonly face:

- Heavy congestion during peak hours  
- Increased travel time and delays  
- High accident frequency at specific roads and junctions  
- Inefficient utilization of road infrastructure  
- Overdependence on private vehicles  

Due to the lack of structured analysis, many traffic-related decisions are reactive rather than proactive. This project addresses that gap by using data analytics to enable **informed, evidence-based decision-making**.

## 4. Key Business Questions

This project aims to answer the following questions:

1. During which time periods does traffic congestion peak?  
2. Which roads or locations experience the highest traffic volume?  
3. How does traffic flow differ between peak and off-peak hours?  
4. What factors contribute to higher accident frequency or severity?  
5. What measures can improve traffic flow and road safety?

## 5. Dataset Description

The dataset may include the following attributes:

- Date and time  
- Location, road, or junction  
- Traffic volume  
- Average speed or delay  
- Vehicle type  
- Mode of transport (private, public, non-motorized)  
- Weather and lighting conditions  
- Accident severity (if available)  

Data sources may include open government portals, city transportation datasets, or publicly available datasets.

- Handled missing values  
- Standardized time, location, and categorical fields  
- Created derived features such as:
  - Hour of day  
  - Day of week  
  - Peak vs off-peak classification  

### Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed traffic volume trends over time  
- Compared peak and off-peak traffic behavior  
- Identified congestion-prone roads and locations  
- Examined accident patterns by time and location  

### Step 4: Metric Creation
- Traffic volume indicators  
- Average speed and delay metrics  
- Congestion-level categorization  
- Accident frequency and severity distribution  

### Step 5: Visualization and Reporting
- Developed interactive Power BI dashboards  
- Highlighted key trends using KPIs  
- Applied filters for time, location, and traffic conditions  
- Presented findings in a business-friendly format
