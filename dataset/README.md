# Dataset / Data folder

This directory stores dataset files used by the analysis. Large raw datasets (e.g., `US_Accidents_March23.csv`) are **not** included in the repository to avoid large commits. Download and place such files under `dataset/` if you need to reproduce the results. Keep a small sample dataset (if needed) under `dataset/` for tests and examples.
